A few weeks ago Juan Febles, creator of [Podcast Linux](https://podcastlinux.com/), was kind enough to invite me to chat with him on his show. We mainly talked about the Adam image for portable retro-emulation consoles. We also talked about my beginnings and journey with Linux and free software, an operating system and philosophy that both Juan and I are passionate about.

I would like to thank Juan again for having noticed the Adam project and considering it as interesting content for his podcast, which by the way I encourage you to follow if its subject matter is among your interests.

If you would like to listen to the conversation (in spanish) you can do so right here:
